Whether you’re starting a new job, trying to change your current role (such as deciding which programming skills to learn), or looking to move up the corporate ladder, you don’t have to go it alone. It can be a huge advantage to connect with someone with more experience and a willingness to listen. \
A mentor can fill this role and make a long-term difference in your career.
It’s not just a matter of having a shoulder to cry on. A mentor can be of enormous value in your personal success...
